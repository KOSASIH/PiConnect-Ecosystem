# PiConnect Ecosystem - Charity Donation Integration Example

This document provides an example of how to integrate charity donation functionality into your application using the PiConnect Ecosystem. This integration allows users to easily donate to their favorite charities, enhancing user engagement and supporting charitable causes.

## Overview

Integrating charity donation functionality involves the following key components:

1. **API Integration**: Utilize the PiConnect API to handle donation requests.
2. **Frontend Modifications**: Update the user interface to include charity selection and donation options.
3. **Payment Processing**: Implement secure payment processing for donations.
4. **Confirmation and Notifications**: Provide users with confirmation of their donations and notify charities of received donations.

## Step 1: API Integration

### 1.1. Set Up API Access

To interact with the PiConnect API for charity donations, you need to obtain an API key. This key will be used to authenticate requests made from your application.

1. Register your application with the PiConnect Ecosystem.
2. Obtain your API key from the PiConnect developer portal.

### 1.2. Making Donation Requests

When a user decides to donate to a charity, your application should send a POST request to the PiConnect API to process the donation.

**Example Request**:

```javascript
const donationData = {
    amount: 20.00, // Amount to donate
    charityId: 'charity123', // ID of the selected charity
    userId: 'user123', // ID of the user making the donation
};

fetch('https://api.piconnect.org/donations', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(donationData),
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    console.log('Donation successful:', data);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Error processing donation:', error);
});
```

## Step 2: Frontend Modifications

### 2.1. Update User Interface

Modify your applicationâ€™s user interface to include a section for users to select a charity and enter the donation amount. This can be a form that users fill out before submitting their donation.

**Example UI Component**:

```html
<div>
    <h3>Donate to Charity</h3>
    <label for="charitySelect">Select Charity:</label>
    <select id="charitySelect">
        <option value="charity123">Charity Name 1</option>
        <option value="charity456">Charity Name 2</option>
    </select>
    <label for="donationAmount">Donation Amount:</label>
    <input type="number" id="donationAmount" placeholder="Amount" />
    <button id="donateButton">Donate</button>
</div>

<script>
    document.getElementById('donateButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
        const charityId = document.getElementById('charitySelect').value;
        const amount = document.getElementById('donationAmount').value;
        sendDonation(charityId, amount);
    });

    function sendDonation(charityId, amount) {
        // Implement the donation logic here
    }
</script>
```

### 2.2. Handle Donation Submission

When the user clicks the donate button, include the donation data in the request to the PiConnect API as shown in Step 1.2.

## Step 3: Payment Processing

### 3.1. Implement Payment Processing

To securely process payments for donations, integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) into your application. This will handle the actual transaction and ensure that funds are transferred securely.

**Example Payment Integration**:

```javascript
// Example using Stripe
const stripe = require('stripe')('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');

async function processPayment(amount, token) {
    const charge = await stripe.charges.create({
        amount: amount * 100, // Amount in cents
        currency: 'usd',
        source: token, // Token generated by Stripe.js
        description: 'Charity Donation',
    });
    return charge;
}
```

## Step 4: Confirmation and Notifications

### 4.1. Confirm Donations

After successfully processing a donation, provide users with a confirmation message indicating that their donation was successful.

**Example Confirmation Logic**:

```javascript
function confirmDonation() {
    alert('Thank you for your donation!');
}
```

### 4.2. Notify Charities of Donations

After processing the donation, notify the charity of the received funds. This can be done through email notifications or in-app notifications.

**Example Notification Logic**:

```javascript
function notifyCharity(recipientId, amount) {
    // Logic to send notification (e.g., email, in-app)
    console.log(`Notified ${recipientId} of a $${amount} donation received.`);
}
```
