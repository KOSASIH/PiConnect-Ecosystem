# PiConnect Ecosystem - Architecture Overview

The PiConnect Ecosystem is designed to facilitate charitable giving through a user-friendly platform that connects donors with charities. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, including the key components, their interactions, and the technologies used.

## System Architecture

The architecture of the PiConnect Ecosystem follows a client-server model, consisting of a frontend application, a backend API, and a database. The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:

```
+-------------------+          +-------------------+          +-------------------+
|                   |          |                   |          |                   |
|   Frontend        | <------> |   Backend API     | <------> |   Database        |
|   (React)         |          |   (Node.js,       |          |   (MongoDB)      |
|                   |          |    Express)       |          |                   |
+-------------------+          +-------------------+          +-------------------+
```

### 1. Frontend

- **Technology**: React
- **Description**: The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built using React. It provides a responsive user interface for users to interact with the platform. Key features include:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Browsing and searching for charities
  - Making donations
  - Viewing transaction history and notifications
  - Analytics dashboard for users and administrators

### 2. Backend API

- **Technology**: Node.js, Express
- **Description**: The backend is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express. It handles all business logic and data processing. Key responsibilities include:
  - User management (registration, login, profile management)
  - Charity management (CRUD operations for charities)
  - Donation processing (handling donations and transaction records)
  - Notification management (sending and retrieving notifications)
  - Analytics (providing insights into donations and user engagement)

### 3. Database

- **Technology**: MongoDB
- **Description**: The database is a NoSQL database that stores all application data, including user profiles, charity information, donation records, and notifications. MongoDB is chosen for its flexibility and scalability, allowing for easy handling of varying data structures.

## Component Interactions

The following outlines the interactions between the components of the PiConnect Ecosystem:

1. **User  Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the frontend application through a web browser. They can register, log in, browse charities, and make donations.

2. **API Requests**:
   - The frontend communicates with the backend API via HTTP requests. For example, when a user makes a donation, the frontend sends a POST request to the `/charities/:charityId/donate` endpoint.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - The backend processes the requests, performs necessary validations, and interacts with the database to store or retrieve data.

4. **Database Operations**:
   - The backend uses MongoDB to perform CRUD operations on the data. For instance, when a donation is made, the backend records the transaction in the database.

5. **Response Handling**:
   - After processing the request, the backend sends a response back to the frontend, which updates the user interface accordingly (e.g., displaying a success message or updating the transaction history).

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to protected routes.
- **Data Validation**: Input data is validated on both the frontend and backend to prevent malicious data from being processed.
- **HTTPS**: The application should be served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

## Conclusion

The architecture of the PiConnect Ecosystem is designed to provide a robust and scalable platform for charitable giving. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices, the system aims to deliver a seamless user experience while ensuring data security and integrity. This overview serves as a foundation for understanding the system's components and their interactions, facilitating further development and contributions to the project.
