# PiConnect Ecosystem - Gaming Platform Integration Example

This document provides an example of how to integrate the PiConnect Ecosystem with gaming platforms. This integration allows gamers to support their favorite charities or content creators through in-game tipping or donations, enhancing community engagement and social impact.

## Overview

Integrating the PiConnect Ecosystem with gaming platforms involves the following key components:

1. **API Integration**: Utilize the PiConnect API to handle donation and tipping requests.
2. **In-Game UI Modifications**: Update the gaming interface to include donation options.
3. **Payment Processing**: Implement secure payment processing for tips and donations.
4. **Notification System**: Notify content creators or charities of received donations or tips.

## Step 1: API Integration

### 1.1. Set Up API Access

To interact with the PiConnect API for donations and tips, you need to obtain an API key. This key will be used to authenticate requests made from your gaming platform.

1. Register your gaming application with the PiConnect Ecosystem.
2. Obtain your API key from the PiConnect developer portal.

### 1.2. Making Donation and Tipping Requests

When a player decides to tip a content creator or donate to a charity, your application should send a POST request to the PiConnect API to process the transaction.

**Example Request**:

```javascript
const donationData = {
    amount: 10.00, // Amount to donate or tip
    recipientId: 'charity123', // ID of the recipient (charity or content creator)
    userId: 'user123', // ID of the user making the donation or tip
};

fetch('https://api.piconnect.org/donations', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(donationData),
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    console.log('Donation successful:', data);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Error processing donation:', error);
});
```

## Step 2: In-Game UI Modifications

### 2.1. Update Game Interface

Modify your gaming platform's interface to include options for players to tip or donate. This can be a button or menu option that players can access during gameplay.

**Example UI Component**:

```html
<div>
    <h3>Support Your Favorite Creator</h3>
    <button id="tipButton">Tip $10</button>
</div>

<script>
    document.getElementById('tipButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
        // Call the donation function here
        sendDonation();
    });

    function sendDonation() {
        // Implement the donation logic here
    }
</script>
```

### 2.2. Handle Donation Submission

When the player clicks the tip button, include the donation data in the request to the PiConnect API as shown in Step 1.2.

## Step 3: Payment Processing

### 3.1. Implement Payment Processing

To securely process payments for donations and tips, integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) into your gaming application. This will handle the actual transaction and ensure that funds are transferred securely.

**Example Payment Integration**:

```javascript
// Example using Stripe
const stripe = require('stripe')('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');

async function processPayment(amount, token) {
    const charge = await stripe.charges.create({
        amount: amount * 100, // Amount in cents
        currency: 'usd',
        source: token, // Token generated by Stripe.js
        description: 'Donation or Tip',
    });
    return charge;
}
```

## Step 4: Notification System

### 4.1. Notify Recipients of Donations and Tips

After successfully processing a donation or tip, notify the recipient (content creator or charity) of the received funds. This can be done through in-game notifications or external notifications (e.g., email).

**Example Notification Logic**:

```javascript
function notifyRecipient(recipientId, amount) {
    // Logic to send notification (e.g., in-game, email)
    console.log(`Notified ${recipientId} of a $${amount} donation or tip received.`);
}
```

## Conclusion

Integrating the PiConnect Ecosystem with gaming platforms allows players to support their favorite charities and content creators directly through gameplay. By following the steps outlined in this document, you can successfully implement donation and tipping functionality, enhancing player engagement and social impact.
